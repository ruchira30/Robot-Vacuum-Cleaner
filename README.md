Autonomous Robot Vacuum Cleaner

Overview

This project showcases an autonomous robot vacuum cleaner built with an Arduino microcontroller. The robot is designed to navigate and clean surfaces while avoiding obstacles, illustrating practical applications of embedded systems and robotics.

Features

- Autonomous navigation and surface cleaning.
- Obstacle avoidance using an ultrasonic distance sensor.
- Real-time object detection programmed in C/C++ (Arduino), with a buzzer that activates when an object is within a 15 cm range.
- Vacuum functionality provided by a DC motor, fan, and battery.
- Assembled on a car-type prototype for mobility.

Hardware Components

- Arduino Microcontroller: Central control unit.
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor: Measures the proximity of nearby objects.
- DC Motor: Drives movement and suction.
- Fan: Facilitates vacuuming.
- Battery: Powers the robot.
- Buzzer: Alerts when an object is detected within 15 cm.
- Car Prototype: Cardboard model with rubber wheels for movement.

Software

The robotâ€™s behavior is programmed in C/C++ using the Arduino IDE. The code includes:

- Object Detection: Real-time processing to detect objects within 15 cm.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Logic for maneuvering around obstacles.
